==================
testcases_trx2txt.sh: testcase 20 fails on OpenBSD, cause parameter buffer is only 2048 Bytes

I14: 30jul16, svn:
==================
try cold storage with this: 1JmPRD_unspent.txt

I16: 31jul16, svn:
==================
testcases_trx_2txt.sh: testcase 9 on OpenBSD failes this way:
need to take care for buffering input?
TESTCASE 9c: 
cut: [-bcf] list: 2072 too large (max 2048)
cut: [-bcf] list: 2080 too large (max 2048)
cut: [-bcf] list: 2082 too large (max 2048)
...

I19: 09Oct2016, svn:
====================
I think the maximum size of a trx is 100 kb. How many trx does that make? 
How can this be implemented?
--> minimum signature is ~50 Bytes, prev trx = 32 Bytes + PKScript 20 Bytes plus, plus, plus... so a minimum trx is roughly 227 Bytes. This would limit to ~440 particular trx? And if a trx has many inputs and many outputs?

trx validation:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules#.22tx.22_messages
    Check syntactic correctness
    Make sure neither in or out lists are empty
    Size in bytes <= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (or as above, 100k max?)
    Each output value, as well as the total, must be in legal money range
    Make sure none of the inputs have hash=0, n=-1 (coinbase transactions)
    Check that nLockTime <= INT_MAX[1], size in bytes >= 100[2], and sig opcount <= 2[3]
    Reject "nonstandard" transactions: scriptSig doing anything other than pushing numbers on the stack, or scriptPubkey not matching the two usual forms[4]
    Reject if we already have matching tx in the pool, or in a block in the main branch
    For each input, if the referenced output exists in any other tx in the pool, reject this transaction.[5]
    For each input, look in the main branch and the transaction pool to find the referenced output transaction. If the output transaction is missing for any input, this will be an orphan transaction. Add to the orphan transactions, if a matching transaction is not in there already.
    For each input, if the referenced output transaction is coinbase (i.e. only 1 input, with hash=0, n=-1), it must have at least COINBASE_MATURITY (100) confirmations; else reject this transaction
    For each input, if the referenced output does not exist (e.g. never existed or has already been spent), reject this transaction[6]
    Using the referenced output transactions to get input values, check that each input value, as well as the sum, are in legal money range
    Reject if the sum of input values < sum of output values
    Reject if transaction fee (defined as sum of input values minus sum of output values) would be too low to get into an empty block
    Verify the scriptPubKey accepts for each input; reject if any are bad
    Add to transaction pool[7]
    "Add to wallet if mine"
    Relay transaction to peers
    For each orphan transaction that uses this one as one of its inputs, run all these steps (including this one) recursively on that orphan


I22: 12Oct2016, svn:
====================
trx_create.sh - testcase 6: wenn er doch ins Netz geht, und die TRX mit '-t' holt,
kann er auch gleich checken, ob genug "input Satoshis" da sind, um den Transferbetrag und die TRXFEE zu bezahlen...

I24: 14Oct2016, svn:
====================
trx_create.sh - trxfee calculation:
# trx fees are calculated  with a trx fee per byte, which is changing...
# currently in Sep 2016 it is roughly 50 Satoshis per Byte. Exact length can only
# be determined during signing process, but here is a rough calc: each input
# requires later on a signature (length=70 Bytes/140 chars), which replaces
# the existing PKSCRIPT (length 25 Bytes, 50 chars). Each input must be signed,
# so roughly 90 chars signature are added. Normal 1 input one output P2PKH trx are
# roughly 227 Bytes ... THIS NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS !!!
--> need to get empirical data to improve math calculation, P2PKH is min 227 bytes, but P2SH can be much longer, and when SegWit and MerkleTrees come in, even much shorter.
--> when multi-input transactions are used, is the 50Satoshi/Bytes calc still true? What would a reasonable trxfee, if trx is 1000 Bytes?

I25: 17Oct2016, svn:
====================
if network is "on", then get the average last trx fee as proposal in the system... 
wget --no-check-certificate https://bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/list
awk 'BEGIN { RS="},{"; OFS="\n" } { print $1 }' list | grep \"minDelay\":0,\"maxDelay\":0 | head -n1

or look here: https://blockchain.info/de/stats or https://api.blockchain.info/stats
divide total trx costs by amount of trx?
"total_fees_btc":7571592387
"n_tx":245576
= ~30000 Satoshis

I26: 19Oct2016, svn:
====================
start to think about a config file, having default values like:
min_trxfee=50
max_trx_size=100 # kilobytes
SIG_MIN_LENGTH_CHARS=18
SIG_MAX_LENGTH_CHARS=146
...

I27: 25Oct2016, svn:
====================
trx_sign.sh: 
STEP 8:  need to do a var_int check here ...
STEP 17: when there is a trx with multiple output, need to create a loop


I27: 27Oct2016, svn:
====================
need to analyze 4input trx from address 1JmPRDELzWZqRBKtdiak3iiyZrPQT3gxcM 
looks like the signature does not validate. Write small shell script like key2pem.sh?
from compressed key:

--> need to run tcls_sign.sh with one input, then more inputs ...

I28: 02Nov2016, svn:
====================
when tmp_urtx.txt file is missing, then wrong reply by sign script:
./tcls_sign.sh -f tmp_urtx.txt -w XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXQPcN4 -p 03cc5debc62369bd861900b167bc6add5f1a6249bdab4146d5ce698879988dced0

           Exiting gracefully


I29: 02Nov2016, svn:
====================
naming convention(s): 
Bitcoin talks about (unsigned) raw transactions. This word raw is often used (e.g. in the pizza tranasaction) as an indicator for files (pizza.raw), which contain only hex data. So this file cannot be printed easily, you need to use 'xxd' or 'hexdump'. So effectivly the file is a hexadecimal file, not a raw file...
NAMING CONVENTION:
--> 1: files, which need 'xxd' or 'hexdump' need to end with ".hex" (not raw)
--> 2: files that can be displayed with 'cat' shall have the extension ".txt"
--> 3: avoid usage of extension ".raw"
this needs to be inmplemented into tcls_create.sh, tcls_sign.sh and tcls_verify_sig.sh
(and later into all other files)

### Extensions / new Requirements ###
#####################################
E1: Testnet
===============
can it be extended for usage in testnet?

E2: MultiSig
===============
For important values: make use of a 2of3 multisig with one in cold storage
generate 3 addresses (and 3 private keys) A, B & C... and 
create 1 multisig address (D) using those 3 in a 2-of-3 configuration

the multisig address starts with a "3", all the others (A,B & C) should be "1". 
send funds into the multisig address D (starts with a "3")... 
make sure all the private keys for your A, B & C addresses are all backed up/stored independently of each other. 
to take funds out of D, create a transaction using one of A,B or C.. and then co-sign the transaction using one of the other addresses.

E3: Sending
===============
can a signed trx be sent to the net without tools?
